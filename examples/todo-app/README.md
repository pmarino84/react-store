# todo-app example

This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is a simple todo application to show you the usage of the simplest [@pm/reactjs-store](https://github.com/pmarino84/react-store) library.

Inside [store](./src/store) folder you can find the implementation of the global store for the app with @pm/reactjs-store.
